        <p>
        The Japanese Language is a language that is from Japan. It is the national language of the country Japan.</p>
        <p>
        It consists of 3 writing systems: Hiragana, Katakana, and Kanji. Each writing system is used for different purposes and contribute to the Japanese Writing System.</p>
        <p>
        The pronounation is one vowel, or one consonant and one vowel (with the exception of ん or ン, which are one consonant.)</p>
        <br>

        <!--History section-->
        <h3 id="History">History of Writing System</h3>
        <img src="images/writing.jpeg" width="300" alt="Old Japanese Writing">
        <p>
        When people from China came to Japan, they eventually made their own language (Japanese.)</p>
        <p>
        But there was a problem. Japanese didn't have a writing system. The Japanese people wanted a writing system, so they turned their eyes to China.</p>
        <p>
        They went to China, and was like, "Hey China, can I "<i>borrow</i>" your writing system?"</p>
        <p>
        And China was like, "Yeah, you can <i>borrow</i> it."</p>
        <p>
        And then Japan was like, "Cool thanks!" and ran off (they never gave China's writing system back.)</p>
        <p>
        So with a writing language, people started intergrating Japanese into China's writing system.
        Just one problem.</p>
        <p>
        Japanese is a very different language from Chinese, with different pronounation, grammer, rules with the language in general.
        So you can imagine that using Chinese characters was very ineffeciant and hard to do.
        But actually, Japan actually had another writing system.</p>
        <p>
        Hiragana.</p>
        <p>Hiragana was used by women, because that's what they were taught (this is from the lives of Japanese people who were in power/rich.)
        A lot of women actually knew how to read kanji, but acted like they didn't. But women would just write letters and poems and other things in only hiragana.
        </p>
        <p>So Japan now had a another writing system that was made for Japanese.</p>
        <p>But that's not all. There was one more writing system they had.</p>
        <p>Katakana.</p>
        <p>Katakana came to existence from monks. Monks would take pieces of kanji (called radicals) to use in writing. Which made Katakana.</p>
        <p>That's why some katakanas look like parts of kanji.</p>
        <p>So people eventually started using hiragana and katakana with kanji, and that's how the writing system we have today came to be.</p>

        <br>

        <!--Hiragana section-->
        <h3 id="Hiragana">Hiragana</h3>
        <img src="images/hiragana_chart.png" width="300" alt="Hiragana chart">
        <p>Hiragana is one of the 3 writing systems. It is the first writing systems taught to Japanese kids (and in Japanese language courses), mostly because of how easy it is (and because it's the "building blocks" of Japanese).</p>
        <p>Each hiragana has a sound to it, and it is <i>always</i> pronounced the same (unlike English; look at the words f<strong>a</strong>ther, <strong>a</strong>pple, <strong>a</strong>pe.)</p>
        <p>The vowels are a (pronounced "ah"), i ("pronounced ee"), u (pronounced "oo" in "fool"), e (pronounced "eh"), o (pronounced "oh"). </p>
        <p>Like I said in the Overview, each character that starts with a consonant ends with a vowel (for example "ba", "ni", "ko"), except for ん, which is "n".</p>
        <p>Hiragana has every sound in the Japanese language (unless if you want to add sounds), therefore it's taught first (and every character is pronounced the same).</p>
        <p>Hiragana is used for particles (kind of like "in", "a", and "the" in English), onomatopoeia, and some words.</p>
        <br>

        <!--Katakana section-->
        <h3 id="Katakana">Katakana</h3>
        <img src="images/katakana_chart.png" width="300" alt="Katakana chart">
        <p>Katakana is one of the 3 writing systems. It's ususally taught second since hiragana is taught first.</p>
        <p>The thing is that katakana is basically the same as hiragana, just that it's written differently.</p>
        <p>Think of it like uppercase and lowercase letters. Uppercase and lowercase letters mean the exact same thing, but are written differently and are used for different things.</p>
        <p>Katakana is mostly used for loan words, like コーヒー (ko-hi-, coffee).</p>
        <p>It also can be used for onomatopoeias and words that aren't loan words (sometimes).</p>

        <br>

        <!--Kanji section-->
        <h3 id="Kanji">Kanji</h3>
        <img src="images/kanji.jpg" width="300" alt="Picture of some Kanji">
        <p>Kanji is one of the 3 writing systems. It is the last writing system learned by japanese kids and (usually) japanese learners (for good reason.)</p>
        <p>Kanji is known for it's complexity, and is usually the thing that makes japanese learners quit (aside from "language plateau".)</p>
        <p>Why? First, there is over <strong>50,000</strong> kanji. Good thing is that you only have to learn about <em>2,000</em> to read most (basically all) text.</p>
        <p>Also, each kanji character has more than one reading. This is because when Japan got their writing system from China (which is kanji), they had a Chinese pronounation (called on'yomi) and a Japanese pronounation (called kun'yomi.)</p>
        <p>The only way you can tell how to pronounce it is mostly by context. Luckily, if the pronouncation of the kanji is unusual, then furigana (hiragana/katakana on top of beside kanji to indicate the pronouncation of said kanji) will be used (especially with songs.)</p>
        <p>Last thing. Since kanji is basically Chinese, writing/reading it can be hard.</p>
        <p>Now, you may be sweating bullets right now, especially if you want to learn Japanese. But <strong>don't worry!</strong> There is a way to learn kanji without feeling like you're going through a torture camp. And it's really easy.</p>
        <p><strong><em>Just learn words instead of individual kanji.</em></strong></p>
        <br>

        <!--Pitch accent section-->
        <h3 id="Pitch">Pitch accent</h3>
        <img src="images/pitch_accent.jpg" width="300" alt="A graph of pitch accent">
        <p>Pitch accent is a part of the Japanese language with sound.</p>
        <p>Pitch accent is a system of where different sounds is distinguished by different "pitches".</p>
        <p>Each syllable (refer back to Hiragana/Katakana chapter) is a certain sound, and will have a certain pitch assigned to it. This helps with distinguishing words from each other.</p>
        <p>For example, there is 雨 (あめ, ame, "rain") and 飴 (あめ, ame, "candy"). They look the same if you write it in Hiragana (or romaji), but are different in Kanji. The thing is, "rain" and "candy" mean different things, and if you can only tell the difference in writing (only with Kanji), how do people communicate, since there are <em>many</em> examples of this?</p>
        <p>Well, pitch accent comes to save the day!</p>
        <p>雨 has an up-down pitch, while 飴 has a down-up pitch. This is how Japanese people can tell if someone is saying if rain is falling or candy is falling.</p>
        <p>This is also why the argument for getting rid of kanji does not work. If Japanese only used Hiragana and Katakana, or just Hiragana/Katakana, Japanese would have a hard time reading, because they wouldn't know with meaning it's saying. There are sometimes 6 different words that would look the same in Hiragana/Katakana, but different in kanji. </p>
        <br>

        <img src="images/japanese_words.webp" width="250" alt="A picture of japanese words">
        <p>This is a section where there are some words of Japanese. I will include the word in it's actual state, furigana, and romaji, and a link to the word to jpdb, a Japanese dictonary website. This will show everything, including the sound of the word and pitch accent (except for pitch accent). </p>
